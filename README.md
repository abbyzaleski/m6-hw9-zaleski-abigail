Overall, the assignment went better than previous assignments had regarding the JavaScript side of things. I still had a difficult time getting things going and knowing where to start. Once I had linked the API correctly, I was able to utilized our lecture and notes to work through the other portions of the JavaScript code.

I did run into some issues with the Description and Icon portions of the assignment, and I was unable to figure out how to get those to return the correct results.
